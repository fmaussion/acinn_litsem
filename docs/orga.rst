Organisation of the seminar
===========================

We meet every week at 14:30 in the Besprechungsraum and discuss a paper
together. One student has to prepare and lead the discussion. This does not
require to prepare a presentation, but implies to be able to condense and
summarize the results to the other participants.

"Leading the discussion" means to encourage discussion by asking questions,
pointing to unclear or interesting parts of the paper, etc. An incomplete,
informal "paper checklist" is provided below to help us orientate the
discussion.


Propose a paper for discussion
------------------------------

Everybody is allowed (encouraged!) to propose a paper for discussion. Write
me an `email`_ with your suggestions and I will update the paper list.

In principle you can submit a paper about any topic, but you should pay
attention to a couple of points:

- the paper should not be too long (10 pages is good, 15 pages would be an
  upper limit, with 20 pages the paper should be outstanding)
- without being too simple, the paper should not be overly complicated or
  addressed to an expert audience.

Selection of the next paper
---------------------------

The selection procedure for the following week will follow three steps:

- voluntary basis (a student asks to present a paper): this should
  happen on Tuesday.
- democracy: if no paper is selected on Tuesday, I will ask people to
  express their prefered paper by Thursday, and I will design the presenter.
- tyranny: if nothing happens by Friday, I will design a paper and a presenter.


Paper checklist
---------------

**General questions:**

- Is the study innovative or original?
- Does the study challenge existing paradigms or add to existing knowledge?
- is the paper oriented towards a specialist audience? Or a general audience?

**Writing, structure:**

- Is the paper written in a clear and easily understandable style?
- Does the title accurately reflect the content of the paper?
- Are the research questions clearly formulated? Where?
- Do the conclusions answer the research questions initially posed?
- Is the work well organized and structured?
- Does the discussion extend beyond the methods and results of the study?
- Is the paper too long / too short?

**Scientific rigor:**

- Do the data and results support the conclusions?
- Are the methods and data presented in a clear and unambiguous manner? Can
  other researchers replicate the work done?
- Are the methods of statistical analysis and level of significance
  appropriate?


Book recommendation
-------------------

I can warmly recommend the book by Joshua Schimel: *Writing Science: How to
Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded* (Oxford
university press).
